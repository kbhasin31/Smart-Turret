# Smart_Turret


A remote turret that can aim and shoot. Espcam and Arduino have been used for the microcontrollers. 

An app has been developed using Flutter that shows the live feed of the espcam to the user and also asks for permission from the user to allow the turret to shoot.
Users can also take snapshots of particular events if required. These images are stored in google fire storage and can be accessed from anywhere.
